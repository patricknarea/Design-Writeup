# Project Design Writeup and Approval Template

*	Problem:	The problem to be investigated revoles around the secondary market of the collectible card game, Magic: The Gathering.  The secondary market of Magic cards provides ample opportunity for investment, especially since said market is currently unregulated and looks to remain this way.  Due to this lack of regulation it is beneficial to understand what significant variables affect this secondary market, as well as identify any patterns in behaviour of the secondary prices of expansion sets and their subsequent cards.

*	Hypothesis:	Expansion sets that contain the following, will retain the most value (greastest percentage of price 				 growth):
					1) Significant number of cards placed on the "reserved list"
					2) Significant number of cards played with in "legacy" and "modern" formats
						a) Significant number of "mana" producing cards played in said formats
				Cards that have the following attributes, will retain the most value (greastest percentage of price growth):
					1) "Mana" producing
					2) Placed on "reserved list"
					3) Mainly played professionally on the tournament circuit

*	Impact:		If sets/cards (chosen upon completion of prediction process) maintain a yearly return at least 7% (					for 5 years, then the possibility of utilizing Magic cards as an alternative for savings investment 				becomes viable.

				Factors, having the most impact in predicting said value, will be availability of data, ease of access to available data, and past cutoff dates for said data. 

*	Data Available:	(was not able to provide sample return for the following data resources)
					1) www.mtggoldfish.com
					2) www.mtgjson.com
					3) www.mtgprice.com

*	Domain Knowledge:	I have prior experience predicting stock prices based on market factors and specific stock 							behaviour.  As per Magic: The Gathering directly, I have been investing in its secondary 							market with success, for the past 6 years.  Having researched more indepth for the past 6 							months, as well as carry-over from predicting stock behaviour, I have developed intuitive 							mental models predicting the growth of specific sets/cards.  At the moment, there are several 						people whom write regularly about the price behaviour Magic's secondary market.  The majority 							of articles and data found predict mainly card growth, using meta-game speculation as its 							primary model, as well as "hype".  The tournament formats are divided into 4 sections:								Standard, Legacy, Modern, Vintage.  While the vast majority of players compete in standard, 						there is bi-yearly rotation of cards legal in this format.  This limits the accuracy in being 						able to predict growth.  There is much more volatility in the value (both in meta-game and 								price) of the cards in this small timeframe format. Thus, legacy and modern will be the main 						focus of this investigation. 

*	Project Concerns:	1) Not being able to manipulate the data as well as I would like.
						2) Ideally, being able to analyze and comb all the written articles, as well as the twitter data and tournament results, would provide a more accurate picture.  Implementing this is the next iteration of this project.
						3) The cost of this model being wrong is losing money in an investment, and vice-versa for the model being correct.
						4) Some of the data may have been entered inaccurately, but this would not affect the results terribly since I am searching for predictors in similar cards/sets.

*	Outcomes:	I am looking for significant set/card attributes that, when applied to seperate past data, will 					predict set/card price growth.  The general audiance would be someone looking into an alternative or 				unregulated investment.  Thus, the most significant data presented would be:
							1) said attributes which are able to predict the best percentage of growth.
							2) "reccent" specific cards/sets which are predicted to have the best growth.
